<!--
**srtjazz/srtjazz** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Python.
- 💬 Ask me about Front-End Development
- 😄 Pronouns: he/she
- ⚡ Fun fact: There's a ressemblance between me and a music genre that is quite unique 🎷
